        <p>This easy to make classic Italian dessert is layered with coffee-soaked and rum flavored ladyfingers, creamy mascarpone custard and whipped cream. No baking necessary!</p>
        <h3>Origins of Tiramisu</h3>
        <p>Translating to "pick-me-up," tiramisu is a layered Italian dessert having dated back to the late 1960s in the region of Treviso, Italy. Ado Campeol, a famous Italian restaurateur, is credited as the inventor of tiramisu, and is considered to be the "father of tiramisu."</p>
        <h3>There's Rum?</h3>
        <p>Traditionally, tiramisu is to be made with Marasala wine instead of rum. It is commonly made with coffee and rum, as it does in this recipe.</p>
        <p>However, whether you prefer the additional flavoring or not, rum can be subsituted with a rum flavoring, or entirely left out. If the latter, the coffee used would have to be extra strong in order to compensate.</p>
