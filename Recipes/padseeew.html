        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pad See Ew is the saltier stir fried noodles to its sweet and nutty cousin, Pad Thai. Its name meaning "stir fried soy sauce noodles," Pad See Ew is a popular Thai street food.</p>
        <h3>Tip to making Pad See Ew</h3>
        <p>The two pivotal components in making Pad See Ew are the sauce and the caramlizing of the noodles. It's common to see recipes instruct the use of just soy sauce and sugar, but that's the easy way of doing it! But that could get in the way of getting the right level of caramlization on the noodles.</p>
        <p>The solution? Separate the noodles from the stir fry, making it easier to caramelize.</p>
