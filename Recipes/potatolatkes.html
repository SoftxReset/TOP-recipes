        <h2>Steps in making Latkes</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice the peeled potatoes and run them through a food process with the grater attachment. Then place the shredded potatoes in a cheesecloth and wring throroughly.</li>
            <li>Take 2 cups of the shredded and dried potatoes and place into a bowl. Add egg, flour, onion and salt. Stir until combined.</li>
            <li>Heat 1/4 inch of the peanut oil in a large skillet over medium to high heat. Place large spoonfulls of the potato mixture into the hot oil and press down. This should make thin potato patties. Cook until golden brown, about 4-5 minutes. Flip the patties and repeat on the other side.</li>
            <li>Remove the latkes from the oil and allow them to drain while cooking any remaining latke "batter." Serve hot.</li>
